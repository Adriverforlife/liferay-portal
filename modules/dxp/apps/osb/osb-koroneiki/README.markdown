Koroneiki is a centralized system that retains customer information related to what products they have purchased, licenses they have consumed, what their roles and permissions are, etc. It can be thought of as Liferay's Entitlement Management System.

### Why the name Koroneiki?
Setting up a core foundation is analogous to a rootstock. A rootstock is part of a plant, often an underground part, from which new above-ground growth can be produced. Olive trees are commonly cultivated by grafting onto good rootstocks, and Koroneiki is a specific species of Olive trees.
Also, the short name for Koroneiki is Kor which sounds a lot like Corp, which was the name of the previous models.
